          <h3>Early life:</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            At a young age, my family relocated frequently. This contributed to a decision - starting in fourth grade - to homeschool me.<br>
            Much of my teenage years were then spent between recreational reading, painting, and video gaming. Unfortunately, the combination of<br>
            reclusive hobbies and being homeschooled resulted in over a decade of lost opportunities to develop and hone social skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Twenties:</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
          A large part of my twenties were spent blooming into the world; forcing myself to socialize, attending regular gatherings, and so forth.<br>
          Because of both my curiosity and my background with "not knowing anything about what reality is like for other people", <br>
          I had a unique perspective in exploring the world, and a singular passion for understanding others' perspective and experience of reality. <br>
          This has, in turn, led to a bit of a personal fascination about the human experience; research into aphantasia is a perfect example of just how <br>
          much we take for granted about "shared reality" that may not, in fact, be safe to do so. A representative example would be in how <br>
          I discovered I was gifted. There are mathematical-, spatial-, and structural-reasoning things that are as intuitive for me as breathing. 
          However, as I began to experience more of the world, I came to understand that these things are not that way for most others. <br>
          In many ways, I could be considered "gifted" in those aspects.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Recent years: </h3>
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2010 I began studying Biology with the eventual goal of studying Gerentology (how biology changes as we age). <br>
          After graduating from Seattle Pacific University with a B.S. in Molecular Biology (2017), I almost immediately became seriously ill for the better part of a year. During that time,
          and for much of the following year as well, I applied for positions in my field across the US. Unfortunately, I was not able to find a position in my field. This has           resulted in me spending the last ~12 months (as of March 2020) investigating other viable career options - the most recent of which being <br>
          programming bootcamp with Epicodus. Which brings us here, to this site, which I have constructed as part of its coursework!
