        <p>My hobbies are constantly changing; throughout my life I have consistently enjoyed video games... however,<br>
          I find that they rarely provide me the fulfillment I have come to crave. They are not a hobby that is ever going to "take me anywhere"<br>
          therefore, more often than not, I wind up feeling as if I have burned my time into oblivion after having played them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of that, I have discovered two primary motivations for having a given hobby:<br>
        </p>
        <ol id="hobbies-list">
          <li>That I am sharing an experience with someone (in which case, 'what we're doing' is mostly unimportant in the face of 'who I am doing it with')</li>
          <li>Building - or building towards - things. Examples are:
            <ul>
              <li>My metal arts, which I would love to have more time spend on (as well as a shop to do it in!)</li>
              <li>Expanding my knowledge, with the goal of developing something ('doing science' falls in this category)</li>
              <li>Bringing existing concepts in-line with their optimal functionality: think what Tesla has done with cars, applied to everything.</li>
            </ul> 
          </li>
        </ol>
