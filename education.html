          My undergraduate studies in Molecular Biology primarily focused on equipping me for research in the biology field. This program emphasized extensive next-gen technique
          familiarity, and constant exposure to real-world research conditions. Additionally, we were specifically and intentionally trained to operate at every level
          of the project heirarchy: from accurately utilizing SOPs to shift safe and sanitized information upwards in the project heirarchy ("Entry Level"), to 
          full autonomous responsibility for the research, development, materials acquisition, implementation, execution, and results analysis/presentation of a novel research
          project ("Project R&D/Management"). These projects also frequently involved leading a team of junior students in the execution of said projects, requiring us
          to learn extensive leadership/soft skills such as conflict management.
